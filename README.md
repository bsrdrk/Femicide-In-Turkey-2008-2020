# Femicide-In-Turkey-2008-2020
This project is the subject of the femicide in Turkey in January 2008 and August 2020, and their graphics. 

### Dataset 
The dataset was created by Büşra Durak and Yağmur Sezen Demir by capturing the news on the internet with Selenium, we made data cleaning and transfered it to Excel. Since the data is taken from the news on the internet, it is not hundred percent accurate.

There may be changes in the data due to the fact that some expressions used in Turkish are the same or not at all in English. For example, in Turkish, the phrase 'Religious Wedding Husband' is taken as her husband in English, but not her husband in Turkish. So number of husband in English dataset is higher than Turkish dataset.
